Welcome to cryptoC
==================

The cryptoC is a Cryptography implement by C

Build example
------------------------

This assumes you have a shell in the project directory, and scons (python) is installed

1.  `% scons`

We build a static library **libcryptoc.a** 

1.  `% cd ./ut/rsa`
2.  `% scons`

We build a executable file **ut_rsa** 

Road map
-----------

+ Block Cipher
  + DES (DES 3-DES)
  + AES
+ Public Key Cryptography
  + RSA
* MAC
  + SHA (SHA1 SHA512)
